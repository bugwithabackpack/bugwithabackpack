    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi there. I'm Bug. I'm a 27-year-old aspiring traveler, amateur photographer, and novice coder. As an avid automobile enthusiast, I find joy in every moment behind the wheel, exploring new destinations and embracing the freedom of the open road. Cars, buses, and trucks hold a special place in my mind, each with its unique charm and allure.</p>

    <p>Even though I seldom get the opportunity to fly, I cherish every opportunity to soar through the skies and immerse myself in the beauty of the world from a new perspective. I had a childhood dream of becoming a pilot. </p>
    
    <p>I love forests, highways, mountains, and big cities. New York is my favourite city. I sleep every night, dreaming about my visit to NYC. I often envisage the flight landing at the JFK airport and the bug walking out of it with his backpack.</p>
    
     <p>I love food</p>
