    <h1>About Me</h1>
    Hi there. I'm Bug. I'm a 27-year-old aspiring traveler, amateur photographer, and novice coder. As an avid automobile enthusiast, I find joy in every moment behind the wheel, exploring new destinations and embracing the freedom of the open road. Cars, buses, and trucks hold a special place in my mind, each with its unique charm and allure.

Even though I seldom get the opportunity to fly, I cherish every opportunity to soar through the skies and immerse myself in the beauty of the world from a new perspective. I had a childhood dream of becoming a pilot.
